// So far we have noticed that every time
// we make a change to this code, you have to go back to the terminal
// and stop this process(control+C) and start it again. This is very tedious.
// So I'm going to show you a better way. You're going to install a node package called nodemon.

// for using it, first install nodemon ur choice want to use globally or particular project
// and run nodemon instead of node,
// example: [earlier node index.js/or any filename.js but now nodemon index.js/filename.js]
