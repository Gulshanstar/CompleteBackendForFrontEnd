// ^ --> this character is known as carrot character
// yeah character batata hai ki jab tak major version 4 rahega tab tak rahene do.


// what is semantic versioning & Tilde character meaning here? (Major,Minor.Patch)--> 
// The 1st number is what we call the major version.
// The 2nd one is what we call the minor version.
// And the 3rd one is what we call the patch version.

// PATCH VERSION -- the developers of Mongoose find a bug
// in the current version. 4.13.6. It will fix the bug and 
// release a new version and that version would be 4.13.7.

// MINOR VERSION -- is used for adding minor features that don't break the existing API, 
// so if the Mongoose team add a new feature without breaking the existing API, 
// they would increase the minor version. So that version would be 4.14.0. 0 
// because in that version they haven't found a bug yet, 
// so that version could be unstable. And as they find them and fix bugs, 
// then they will increase the patch version.

// MAJOR VERSION -- And finally if they add a new feature that could potentially break the existing applications
// that depend upon this version of Mongoose, then they will
// increase the major version. So the next major version would be 5.0.0.
